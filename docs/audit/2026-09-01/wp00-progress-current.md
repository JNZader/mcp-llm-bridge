# WP00: current progress and the next production fixes

WP00 has delivered verified components and storage, execution, observability and administrative error-containment fixes, but it is not closed.
The next priority is production HTTP containment, not another isolated scanner precision rule.
This report separates implemented behavior from the evidence still required for canonical unit closure.

## Snapshot and evidence boundaries

- Reconciliation date: **2026-09-06**; the directory retains the original audit date.
- Source snapshot: **`6c9d998`**, `test(execution): align containment regression contracts`.
- Latest recorded verification: **88 regression tests plus 517 scoped tests (605 total), and typecheck passed**.
- All 11 previously recorded baseline failures were resolved through contract-aligned tests; none remain excluded in those runs.
- Those results were supplied by the isolated verification handoff; this documentation task did not rerun them.
- These counts are not the complete product suite and do not establish a whole-product pass.
- The canonical plan contains **68 units**, with 139 edges and 16 waves recorded in its DAG.
- Its eight checked rows are historical bookkeeping, not a current completion percentage.
- Recent implementation used the DIRECT route. It did not update historical SDD completion or attempt state.
- RDD remains disabled for this clone. No review approval is implied by implementation or functional verification.
- Unknown or unverified WP00 completion does not mean the corresponding product feature is absent.

The source reconciliation was bounded: plan, handoff, relevant commits, scanner modules/tests, and selected HTTP routes.
It was not a fresh audit of every historical foundation or all production code.

## Quick path

1. Contain the two remaining `ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-A` operations routes with real route-level RED tests.
2. Address discovery/catalog failure projections in the same unit without blindly redacting successful discovery data.
3. Reconcile remaining `ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-B` sync projections after admin-A coverage is complete.
4. Return to scanner integration when it removes a concrete closure blocker, not merely to add precision.

## Delivered components versus unit closure

| Area | Source evidence | Supported conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| SAFE-CORE | `a0da0fa`; safe-error, operation and telemetry primitives | Historical implementation and focused evidence exist; not newly re-audited here. |
| SCAN-BIN | `507ef2e`; deterministic codecs and bounded JSON | Historical component evidence exists; not a complete repository scan. |
| AUTH-RUNTIME | `a361e73`; auth runtime/config and focused tests | Historical runtime/config foundation; not completed OAuth, HTTP binding or CSRF. |
| ERR-EXECUTION / ERR-HTTP-FOUNDATION | `02e5a17`, `60278d9` | Historical containment components; remaining route projections still need their own work. |
| ERR-MCP-DYNAMIC / ERR-MCP-SERVER / LOG-CORE | `afe47ec`, `a941749`, `089c984` | Historical scoped implementations; not all MCP, security-wrapper or logging closure. |
| Storage POST/GET | `ef6f2f5`; `test/wp00/err-http-storage.test.ts` | Four real routes return constant internal errors without exception getters or coercion. |
| Storage DELETE | `0457b17`; `test/wp00/err-http-storage-delete.test.ts` | Genuine Vault errors preserve 403/404; unknown failures return constant 500 without inspecting hostile values. |
| Execution HTTP | `1b47695`, `dd94f74`, `2a456e1` | Non-streaming failures, both public SSE protocols and Anthropic preparation use constant errors; genuine validation statuses and streaming lifecycle remain tested. |
| Observability HTTP | `1cb858b` | Local finite validation fields and constant downstream errors; successful data, 503 behavior and the fixed week-dimension message remain compatible. |
| Admin keys/profiles | `d9cab8d` | Six route catches, local validation and structured 404 responses contained; intentional key creation plaintext and revocation behavior retained. |
| Contract regression debt | `6c9d998` | Eleven stale durable-payload/raw-error expectations reconciled; consumer payload/error identity and routing/retry/abort assertions retained. |
| Root API/inventory | `6c4db2e`, `91bb703` | Implemented identity validation and inventory collection; not aggregate admission. |
| Root format components | `05a01b3`, `40c1382`, `4a27cd2`, `be0361d`, `1744307`, `b803363` | Package/shell/Actions/Docker/Compose and bounded PNPM support have component tests. |
| Root integration/reporting | `2ddd3a5`, `87b1f01`, `d47e766` | Classification, existing-snapshot comparison and operational coverage reports are available. |
| AST components/reporting | `f712bdc`, `4e3cebf`, `ad28eec`, `29f7cd0`, `d118294`, `6078724`, `5d3f9a1` | Syntax, bounded bindings, selected direct calls, callbacks and conditional evidence exist; SCAN-AST remains partial. |

Storage and observability are verified slices of `ERR-HTTP-API-B`, not completion of its entire ledger.
The ledger assigns api-keys to `ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-A` but security-profiles to `ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-B`.
Admin-A still owns discovery and operations; fixing keys and profiles did not close either canonical unit.
Execution fixes do not certify every API-A projection or upstream exception normalization.
No handler-level regression suite establishes authentication, CSRF or whole-product safety.
Vault's internal audit messages were preserved for compatibility; these fixes do not establish log sanitization.
Component commits do not automatically satisfy every scenario attached to a canonical row.

## Mandatory closure work still outstanding

### Production behavior

- Finish all ledger-assigned HTTP, MCP, ACP, plugin and security error surfaces.
- Preserve protocol status codes and response envelopes rather than collapsing operational failures into generic statuses.
- Complete the planned auth binding, OAuth, CSRF, administrator and UI behavior with their specified evidence.
- Complete health/provider-registry and cost/circuit/model evidence semantics; missing evidence must not look healthy.
- Close remaining logging, telemetry persistence/readback, UI projections and compatibility requirements.

This reconciliation does not assign an implementation-complete count to these remaining groups.
Existing product implementations may be present; their required WP00 deltas and closure proofs remain unverified here.

### SCAN-ROOT integration

- Complete required registry grammar coverage without relabeling required constructs as optional or unsupported.
- Resolve generated-root provenance and devcontainer execution semantics.
- Integrate independently admitted image/build configurations rather than infer trust from tags or self-computed hashes.
- Assemble the manifest with complete dispatch and prove zero unparsed or unresolved execution roots.
- Preserve authoritative path, mode, length, hash and inventory agreement across passive and execution records.

The earlier storage snapshot recorded the planned `.devcontainer` directory as absent; that filesystem fact was not refreshed here.
Coverage CLI success means a report was produced, not that its roots were admitted or safe.
The existing-snapshot dispatcher is not a first-run authority bootstrap.

### SCAN-AST closure

- Bind current production declarations through independently trusted selection, not historical names or self-hashes.
- Complete the required resolution, controlled-flow and suppression behavior across the actual inventory.
- Address current program/resource limits and the oversized generated bundle without silently omitting files.
- Keep unresolved calls, wrappers, factories, spreads and flows visible until the required gate can close.

Lexical argument references do not prove value origin.
Identity-return summaries are conditional on executing the selected declaration's body; they do not prove runtime call binding.
Neither evidence type establishes safety, admission or whole-program flow closure.

### Hermetic execution, delivery artifacts and final integration

- Complete HERM-RUNNER, loopback/child boundaries, filesystem units and the evidence image.
- Produce the required root-suite evidence through the specified CI integration, with reliable lifecycle/cleanup.
- Finish publication/build provenance, old/generated artifact handling and distribution claims.
- Verify dashboard generation, both CI surfaces, compatibility, claims and final integration.

The historical handoff contains old staging snapshots and native-block records.
Those records remain historical evidence, not a description of today's index or a new DIRECT completion decision.

## Next three production priorities

| Priority | Canonical unit and predecessor | Concrete source gap | Acceptance focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-A; ERR-HTTP-FOUNDATION | `src/server/routes/admin/operations.ts`: two raw catch projections and reflected provider in missing-breaker 404. | Constant 500 without exception inspection; fixed NOT_FOUND 404; unchanged reset/flush effects and NOT_CONFIGURED 404. |
| 2 | ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-A; ERR-HTTP-FOUNDATION | `src/server/routes/admin/discovery.ts`: catalog refresh and discover catch messages. | Trace discovery result errors separately; preserve catalog LOAD_FAILED, NOT_CONFIGURED 404 and intentional success fields. |
| 3 | ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-B; ERR-HTTP-ADMIN-A | `src/server/routes/admin/sync.ts`: remaining typed validation, credential and failure projections. | Preserve INVALID_JSON, MISSING_CREDENTIALS and conflict semantics; do not infer genuine operational status from arbitrary error text. |

The first two slices have the existing HTTP foundation available; no scanner precision extension is needed first.
The third priority remains conditional on admin-A evidence, not merely the committed security-profile slice.
Historical ledger records 336–341 identify operations projections, and 330–335 identify discovery projections.
Those historical indices establish ownership, not current span/hash admission.
Each production slice should start with a failing behavior test and retain its compatibility assertions.

## What can wait without weakening acceptance

Additional scanner precision rules can wait when they do not remove a demonstrated production or integration blocker.
Required grammar, resolution, flow, ownership, suppression and zero-unparsed-root criteria cannot be dropped.
Deferring precision work changes sequencing, not the final acceptance contract.
